# Sudent-Management

# INTRODUCTION

In any Institution you have plenty of students and they are doing different courses 
and you have to keep the record of every single student with their personal details,
course and Score and that is the difficult task to do.
•  The project “Student Information System” is basically Standalone GUI software for
back end purpose for Management of Students record. 
•  This application has three modules 
1. Student Personal details
2. Available course details
3. Student score details

•   In first module we do the records of their personal details and we manage those
records by certain operations. 

•  In Second module we do record of what all courses are available in our Institution
and what is its completion time.

•   In third module we do the record of Scores of the Students got in a particular course
and we manage all those scores. 

•   Based on these records system automatically shows the result for the specific
management request.

•  This system is very easy to use because we provide understandable and simple
Interface for user.

•  This system can be use for efficient management of Students record.

of records of the Students.

easily use it like for example for departments different user end will be provided and for 
examination cell different user end will be provided and etc.

3)  In future we can try to reduce the complexity of User Interface so that user can easily use 
it we can try to make our UI more simpler and clear ,like we can put the provision of search 
system so that user easily find the record and can manage
